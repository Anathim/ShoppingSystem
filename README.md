Developed in the 1970s, Structured Query Language(SQL) is a domain-specific programming language designed to handle data in tables. 

SQL is a language used to extract and update data structured as tables. This kind of data appears in various application areas such as Excel or Google BigQuery. SQL is intended for use with tables that contain rows and columns whereby each row is an object or entity that has a set of properties or attributes. Data is often organized into a set of tables, known as a database.

SQL is a programming language with a large set of data processing features. It is declarative, meaning that a statement written in SQL can be a query that tells the system what should be done or evaluated but doesn't specify how. It's necessary to end each SQL statement with a semicolon, also known as a statement terminator. Else, there will be an error. A semicolon may be omitted only if you make one query at a time. Keywords such as SELECT are not case sensitive in the SQL language, they can be in any letter case but are often written in all caps to make them more visible.

SQL was designed to be as similar as possible to a natural language. Its declarative nature helps to hide the operation's complexities, letting the user define what is required in a relatively straightforward way. The system then analyses the query, chooses the control flow, and executes it. SQL was originally adopted as a standard by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in the 1980s and there are many dialects implemented by software vendors that support it. Dialects are based on the ANSI standard but have some technical differences.

The importance of structured data in SQL lies in the fact that it can be easily searched, queried, and analyzed using various tools and techniques. 

Structured data is an ideal format for data-driven applications such as business intelligence and analytics, as well as for machine learning and artificial intelligence applications.

Dates and Times: Dates and times follow a specific format, making them easy for machines to read and analyze.

Customer Names and Contact Information: When you sign up for a service or purchase a product online, your name, email address, phone number, and other contact details are typically stored as structured data.

Financial Transactions: Financial records, such as transactions made through credit cards or bank accounts, are often stored as structured data.

These examples demonstrate how structured data can be used to store and organize different types of information in a way that is easily accessible and analyzable by computers.
